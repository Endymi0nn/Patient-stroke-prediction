# Patient-stroke-prediction

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A model which predicts whether a medical patient will have a stroke or not, based on the medical data given by the patient.
This model is trained using tensorflow.keras, with the help of numpy and panda libaries
Some functions from sklearn are used for preprocessing, and SMOTE from imblearn is used to handle the  imbalanced dataset
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements : Python 3 + Tensorflow + Numpy + Panda

Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset

Intructions :  Execute runmodel.py after making sure all the files are in the same directory

Other info : 'Showcase.jpg' contains a demonstration of the model's capabilities. Also note that the accuracy of model is 82%.
